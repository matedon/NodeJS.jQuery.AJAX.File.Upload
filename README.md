# NodeJS jQuery AJAX File Upload

This is a simple nodeJS application.

The project is an example to provide a simple AJAX upload solution with jQuery.

jQuery don't has built-in file AJAX upload funcion, but this is a very simple way to write your own. We are using jQuery.ajax() function to upload, HTML5 progressbar to show the upload stream.

You can use any other backend code to handle incomming files. I'm experienced in PHP but nodeJS is a more modern way to build your applications. If you like coding in JavaScript, here is the first chance to write server-side codes in JS too.

We are providing a simple but powerful web aplication, this way you should use a nodeJS framework, Express to get it fast and easy.

If you want to install this code on your computer, just follow:

    sudo apt-get install nodejs
    md /home/user/Projects/ajaxNode
    cd /home/user/Projects/ajaxNode
    git clone https://github.com/matedon/NodeJS.jQuery.AJAX.File.Upload.git
    npm install
    npm install nodemon -g
    nodemon index.js
    http://localhost:8081
